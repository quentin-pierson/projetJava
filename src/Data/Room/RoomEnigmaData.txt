Hum, there are symbols on the walls of this room, perhaps they have a meaning;1
You see a sign with the words: "I finish the night and start tomorrow".;4
You see a sign with the words: "The more it is warm the more it is fresh".;3
There's a lot of lever in this room I wonder what they're for?;2
You see a sign with the words: "Solve : 2x^2 - 9x -5".;3
